# c-sharp-masterclass

## This repository will hold all the code created from the C# Masterclass

I aim to complete the C# Masterclass from Udemy, and will store all work created from that course in this repository

###### Lesson 1 - Installing Visual Studio Community

IDE - Integrated Development Environment

Under Tools > Options - here is where you can change the colour them for Visual Studio

###### Lesson 1.1 - First Program

The Hello World application is usually the first program first time programmers will create.

 > using 'namespace' - allows us to use the exisitng functionality which is already available to us

 > namespace 'HelloWorld' is our project

 > static void Main(String[] args) - This is a method and is the starting point of the program


###### Lesson 2 - Primative Data Types

> Int
Whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

> sbyte
Whole Numbers from -128 to 127

> short
Whole nunbers from -32767 to 32767

> long
Whole numbers from -9,223,327,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,327,036,854,775,808

**You should always use the smallest data type your value fits into**

> Float
Allows decimals and a range from 1.5 x 10^-45 to 3.4 x to 10^38 - (7 Digit Precision)

> Double
Allows decimals and an even higher range than the float - (15 Digit Precision)

> Decimal
Allows decimals and an even higher range than the double - (28-digit Precison)

**When to use float, double or decimal?**

Float, is mostly used in graphic libraries (high demans for processing powers)

Double, is mostly used for real world values (except money calculations)

Decimal, is most used in financial applications (high level of accuracy)

**Other data types**

> bool
Only allows two states: true or false

> char
Allows a single character literal or unicode

> string
Allows multiple letters and unicodes
